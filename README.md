# **Analysing Sakila DVD Rentals**
# Project Description

In this project, you will query the **Sakila DVD Rental** database. The Sakila Database holds information about a company that rents movie DVDs. For this project, you will be querying the database to gain an understanding of the customer base, such as what the patterns in movie watching are across different customer groups, how they compare on payment earnings, and how the stores compare in their performance. To assist you in the queries ahead, the schema for the DVD Rental database is provided [here](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/printable-postgresql-sample-database-diagram.pdf).


*(Note: One quirk you may notice as you explore this "fake" database is that the rental dates are all from 2005 and 2006, while the payment dates are all from 2007. Don't worry about this.)*
